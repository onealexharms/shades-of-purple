# Shades of Purple

Shades of Purple is, for now, primarily about the U.S.political spectrum. It's art, not science. It's not a poll.

These are hard times for us. A lot of us are scared. A lot of us are angry. Messages we get suggest that there are two kinds of people, and that if we can tell which kind someone is, we know whether they're a friend or an enemy.

But people aren't like that. Most of us, however passionate, aren't completely aligned with the scary image of "the other side" that seems to be developing in the collective consciousness.

- A mom in a progressive neighborhood volunteers at a community supper, supports Black Lives Matter, tries to understand and respect transgender people, and can't bring herself to accept abortion, which seems really not-ok to her.

- A Republican dad is heartbroken at the way his kid's transgender friend has been treated, but he doesn't really have a way to talk about it with his friends.

- A married Gay man is a member of Pink Pistols, a group of LGBTQ+ gun owners, and volunteers to elect Democratic candidates.

These are challenging times, full of difficult, important decisions. We need to take a stand. But we can take a stand on issues without dehumanizing our neighbors. Let's disagree with actual people about actual things, instead of imaginary people about every nightmare we can come up with.

## How it might work

The idea is to make a space where people can express their political selves in some way other than to stand on one side of the red/blue line or the other. 

There are 20 prompts, presented in random order. A person will be asked to respond to each one. At the end, there will be a spot-map calculated from the responses that's an image in shades of red and blue and purple. The app will also calculate a unique shade of purple based on those responses.

It was hard to choose only 20 statements.

## Privacy

It's important that the app not track people at all. No cookies, no login, nothing. We won't know who you are.

When you finish the 20 prompts, you'll see a spot-map and a color swatch, both calculated from your responses. It's art, not science, so there's no guarantee it's objective, but the same algorithm will be applied to every set of responses, so in that way any two can be compared. 

You'll get a URL where you can find the specific images created from your responses whenever you want, without logging in or identifying yourself.

A spot-map is like a painting. It doesn't claim to speak for you, but just to capture one set of answers to the set of prompts. You might have mixed feelings, or change your mind. You can go through the prompts as many times as you like, creating different spot-maps each time.

Maps will be saved so they can be displayed as part of a collection, but they won't be connected with people in any way.

## A draft of the app's text and the prompts

You'll see a pair of contrasting statements (some of which you're likely to find quite disagreeable). For each pair, choose the statement you agree with more, or disagree with less. 

Since this is art, not science it's okay to pick the one that most resembles how you feel or think about a topic, even if it doesn't precisely capture the nuance.

### These are the responses you'll be asked choose from for each statement.

Choose:
* I agree wholeheartedly, or this is always true.
* I agree mostly, or this is usually true.
* I agree somewhat, or this is sometimes true.
* I see both sides. It's hard to choose.
* I disagree with both sides.

#### Strength of conviction
How confident are you in the statement you chose?

* I'm open to discussion, and I can imagine learning something that would change my mind.
* I'm pretty confident. It would take a lot to change my mind.
* I'm sure about this. Nothing would change my mind.

#### Importance of the issue
How much does your view on this statement affect the decisions you make?

* It's not that important, in the scheme of things.
* It affects my choices, but not as much as other things.
* It very much affects my choices.

#### Legal priority
How high a priority would you like lawmakers who agree with you to make this issue?

* Keep laws out of it.
* With everything else happening, it's a pretty low priority.
* It's really important, though there's something more important right now..
* This should be top priority until it's settled..
